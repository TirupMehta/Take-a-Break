# Take-a-Break
A minimal, distraction-proof break reminder app built with Python and PyQt5. It forces you to take regular 2-minute breaks every hour with a full-screen overlay, offers up to 3 daily snoozes, and runs quietly in your system tray. Available as a direct Windows app (.exe) or Python source code.
